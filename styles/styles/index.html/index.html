    <br/><H2><strong>What are the monsters of the quiet place</strong></H2>
   <p2>
      In the movie the creatures are known as death angles these creatures have very durible skin which
      helps againts a lot of man maid weapons but due to there heavy armor that they wear they are unable
      to see and are to heavy to be able to swim. Although they have this armor they are increadibly quick
      and able to clime as well as fall from great hights. Though their is still one thing that makes these
      creatures truly deadly and that is their hearing. Their hearing is the creatures most deadly tool,
      the reason is because with their hearing they can hear the smallest of noises. The best way to say
      how good it is, is through an example so lets say you are in a room with the creatur and you set off
      one of thoughs small little egg timmers and usally they have a little clicking sound to them that 
      usaly can't be hear is you walk fare enough away like 6 feet but these creatures can hea that clicking
      from 2 floors up in the same building. Though with that amazing hearing there is a big down fall 
      because with certain noise volumes they can start screaming in pain almost like they got flash bang 
      noise times 200 desmeules.
