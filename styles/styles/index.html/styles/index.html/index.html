      In the movie the creatures are known as death angles these creatures have very durable skin which
      helps against a lot of man maid weapons but due to there heavy armor that they wear they are unable
      to see and are too heavy to be able to swim. Although they have this armor they are incredibly quick
      and able to climb as well as fall from great heights. Though their is still one thing that makes these
      creatures truly deadly and that is their hearing. Their hearing is the creature's most deadly tool,
      The reason is because with their hearing they can hear the smallest of noises. The best way to say
      how good it is, is through an example so lets say you are in a room with the creature and you set off
      one of those small little egg timers and usually they have a little clicking sound to them that
      usually can't be hear is you walk fare enough away like 6 feet but these creatures can hear that clicking
      from 2 floors up in the same building. Though with that amazing hearing there is a big down fall
      because with certain noise volumes they can start screaming in pain almost like they got flash bang
      noise times 200 desmeules.

      Throughout the movies the cast of each of them gets bigger but let's start with the first movie Within
      That movie had a total 0f seven cast members with a majority of them being the main family. first
      is Emily Blunt who play Evelyn Abbott who throughout the movie is pregnant in the world where you can
      not make a noise not to mention no one in her family knows barely any medical knowledge plus no pain killers
      so have fun. Then we got John Kransinski who plays Lee Abbott who throughout the film is trying to help
      his daughter by making a hearing aid to help her hear better when she is on her own he also tries to get
      in contact with people outside of their area farther out in areas all around the world for help while
      still trying to keep his family together. Now we haveMillicent simmonds who plays Regan Abbott who
      throughout both films is death which is why her death is making a hearing aid for. She also is going
      some trauma with her family with the death of her younger brother who she feels like it was her fault.
      Now we got Noah Jupe who plays the middle child Marcus Abbott which in the first film does not do much
      but learns from his father on how to run things on the farm if anything would happen to him. Then is the
      In the second film he shows more of him and how dumb he is outside of his fathers hands. Then we got Cade
      woodward who plays Beau Abbott in the story he does not live long but he does play an important part
      with giving trama to Regan other than that he dies in the first five minutes of the movie.Now that is
      the full cast in movie one then we got movie 2 which only really adds one more character who is Cillian
